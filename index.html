  	<h1>Happy Birthday Nikhita</h1>
  	<p>I am writing this as a means to avoid doing any other work possible, like writing a CV,</p>
    <p>or a cover letter, and I thought those two things were the same,</p>
    <p>but I don't think they are.</p>
    <p>I've decided to write this on an html turned into github because it's cooler</p>
    <p>when you can pull up a page,</p>
    <p>and not a link to a shared google doc.</p>
    <p>we do too much with google documents, docs, it's time we sway away.</p>
    <p>and as long as I have you here,</p>
    <p>I hope you are having a wonderful day, or if that isn't happening,</p>
    <p>then I hope wonderful things await you.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>being the nueroscience nerd you are, </p>
    <p>and being the musical artist you are on the piano keys, </p>
    <p>let's talk about music and neuroscience. </p>
