  	<h1>Happy Birthday Nikhita</h1>
  	<p>I am writing this as a means to avoid doing any other work possible, like writing a CV,</p>
    <p>or a cover letter, and I thought those two things were the same,</p>
    <p>but I don't think they are.</p>
    <p>I've decided to write this on an html turned into github because it's cooler</p>
    <p>when you can pull up a page,</p>
    <p>and not a link to a shared google doc.</p>
    <p>we do too much with google documents, docs, it's time we sway away.</p>
    <p>and as long as I have you here,</p>
    <p>I hope you are having a wonderful day, or if that isn't happening,</p>
    <p>then I hope wonderful things await you.</p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p>being the nueroscience nerd you are, </p>
    <p>and being the musical artist you are on the piano keys, </p>
    <p>let's talk about music and neuroscience. </p>
    <p> ...</p>
    <p> ...</p>
    <p> ...</p>
    <p>My thoughts have centered on rhythm these days, from reading</p>
    <p> Mary Oliver's "A Poetry Handbook" to</p>
    <p> realizing we enjoy conversation more when the cadence of it is natural,</p>
    <p> moreover, when it has an aesthetic beat. </p>
    <p>So, I thought I'd do a deep dive to learn about this from your side of the world </p>
    <p> ...</p>
    <p> Dany Li, says in his YouTube video, "we hear meter, as groups of stronger and weaker beats."</p>
    <p> Mary Oliver writes about the "family of sounds" and the natural turns of heavy and light stresses in words.</p>
    <p> Clocks aren't "tick tick tick tick" but rather "tick tock tick tock" even if it is the same sound</p>
    <p> over and over and over</p>
    <p> ...</p>
    <p> ...</p>
    <p> ...</p>
    <p> According to Mister Li, on the nueral workings of percieving rhythm,</p>
    <p> the sound signals goes through the ear and the vestibulocochlear nerve to reach the</p>
    <p> BRAINSTEM!!!!!</p>
    <p> in which there are "central pattern generators" (CPGs) which drive rhythmic output.</p>
    <p> these CPGs drive the internal metronome. </p>
    <p> which are synchronized to external cycles of music via RhYthMic EnTraiNMent</p>
    <p> and I'd like you to keep in mind, that I am literally copying word for word</p>
    <p> everything Dany Li is saying in this YouTube video.</p>
